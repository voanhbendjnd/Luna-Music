# Playlist Search Functionality Update

## Overview

Updated the "Add Songs to Playlist" modal to use real database queries instead of hardcoded sample data.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Duplicate ID Issue

- Changed modal search input ID from `songSearchInput` to `modalSongSearchInput` to avoid conflict with the main search input

### 2. Implemented Real Song Search

The `loadAvailableSongs()` function now:

- Loads actual songs from the database (passed from backend via `allSongs` array)
- Filters out songs already in the playlist
- Supports search by song title or artist name
- Displays song cover images, titles, artists, and duration
- Shows "No songs found" message when search yields no results

### 3. Search Functionality

The `searchSongs()` function now:

- Reads the search query from the modal input
- Calls `loadAvailableSongs()` with the search term
- Performs real-time filtering as user types (via `onkeyup` event)

### 4. Enhanced UI/UX

- Added CSS styling for modal song items
- Added hover effects and selection highlighting
- Display song cover images in the modal
- Show song duration in MM:SS format
- Improved visual feedback for selected songs

### 5. Data Flow

1. **Backend (PlaylistController.java)**: Already loads all songs via `songDAO.findAll(null)` and passes to JSP
2. **Frontend (playlist-detail.jsp)**:
   - Receives songs data in `allSongs` JavaScript array
   - Filters songs based on search query
   - Excludes songs already in playlist
   - Displays filtered results in modal

## Technical Details

### Backend

No changes needed - the controller already loads and provides all songs:

```java
List<Song> allSongs = songDAO.findAll(null);
request.setAttribute("allSongs", allSongs);
```

### Frontend

The search is performed client-side using JavaScript array filtering:

- Case-insensitive search
- Searches both song title and artist name
- Real-time updates as user types

## Benefits

1. ✅ Real data from database instead of hardcoded samples
2. ✅ Search functionality that works with actual song data
3. ✅ Better user experience with song previews (cover images)
4. ✅ Prevents adding duplicate songs to playlist
5. ✅ Fast client-side search without additional server requests

## Testing Recommendations

1. Open a playlist detail page
2. Click "Add Songs" button
3. Verify all available songs are displayed
4. Test search functionality by typing song names or artist names
5. Verify songs already in playlist are excluded
6. Select songs and add them to the playlist
7. Verify added songs appear in the playlist

## Note

The JSP linter shows some false positive errors due to JSTL syntax embedded in JavaScript. These errors don't affect runtime functionality and are expected in JSP files that mix JSTL with JavaScript.
